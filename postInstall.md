### easyEMWM ###
IF you are reading this, you've installed easyemwm on a Debian/Ubuntu system!
Congratulations, the road ahead is rocky...

Several and thorough recommendations:
* edit your ~/.xinitrc to not have this come up every time you boot
* edit your ~/.emwmrc to change your right-click menu - the runner copies the base one
* edit your ~/.xresources to change emwm settings - I've provided an example of mine in /xresources_xmp

IF these files are not yet made (only xresources shouldn't be), copy my example or get creative!
Please inform me on the GitHub repo or at cameronos on Discord for any bug-reports.
