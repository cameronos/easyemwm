### easyEMWM ###
IF you are reading this, you've installed easyemwm on a Debian/Ubuntu system!
Congratulations, the road ahead is rocky...

Several and thorough recommendations:
* edit your ~/.xinitrc to not have this come up every time you boot
* edit your ~/.emwmrc to change your right-click menu - the runner copies the base one
* edit your ~/.xresources to change emwm settings - I've provided an example of mine in /xresources_xmp
